This project is a Rust implementation of Lox language dialect. It is based on the tutorial of <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com">Crafting Interpreters</a>.
Be aware, that this is by no means considered to be idiomatic Rust, but a somewhat direct translation of a Java-based tutorial.
The first part is completely implemented.
